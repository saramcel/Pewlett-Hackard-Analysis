# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

##Overview

###Purpose
We are preparing Bobby's boss at Pewelett-Hackard a dossier of employees who are retiring and those who might be promoted within the company to replace them. For this, we need to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then we need to deliver advice based on our analysis so that Bobby's boss can handle the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
